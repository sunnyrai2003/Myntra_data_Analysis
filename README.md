To perform data analysis on the Myntra dataset using SQL, we'll use various subqueries, including simple subqueries, nested subqueries, and correlated subqueries. Here is a summary of the tasks:

Calculate the average rating:
Use a simple subquery to find the average rating of all products.
Find products with a rating greater than the average rating:
Use a subquery to find products that have a rating higher than the average rating.
Find products with a discount price greater than the average discount price:
Use a subquery to find the average discount price and then use it to find products that have a discount price greater than this average.
Find unique brand names:
Use a simple subquery to find all unique brand names in the dataset.
Use a nested subquery to find products with the highest rating for each brand:
Use a nested subquery to find the maximum rating for each brand and list the products with those ratings.
Use a correlated subquery to find the highest rated product in each category:
Use a correlated subquery to find the highest rated product in each category.
